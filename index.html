        <h1>Printswell inc - Wharehouse Laborer</h1>
            <p>
                Foil machine operator and general laborer for the fullfilment wharehouse. It was great experience I moved up 5 machines in two and a half years of being there.

        <h1>Sonic Drive-in - Assistant manager</h1>
            <p>
                I never wanted to work at a fast foo restaurant but I was very good at my job and it taught me that I have a freakish willpower to get to top postitions 
                just for personal gratification. Also I became one of the top managers in that area of stores at 19 and other managers did not like me so they plotted my firing 
                which also taught me alot.

        <h1>Thompson highschool - Diploma</h1>
            <p>
                Although I did graduate and recieved my diploma, I had to go to summer school for three different grades because I had totally lost interest 
                in school after I made it to student council. I do look back at those times alot because thats how I learned I like to do things under pressure 
                because if its just about a grade and nothing is on the line I get ADHD about it.

        <h1>SOT Columbiana school of technology - Auto Mechanics</h1>
            <p>
                Trade school is where I learned that I am very hands on as well as good under pressure and time limits. However once it went from hands on to textbook
                work the same thing happened I lost interest and failed the second year of auto mechanics because I simply needed my hands on learning. It also taught me 
                that I am by nature a problem solver.
